              I was really curious about VUE and after watching some tutorials I decided to try. 
              The product page has vue components, the color of the bristles changes on hover, also you can add multiple items to the cart and see them in the modal window. 
              I couldn't make those things as nice and smooth as i wanted, but still it is a great experience.
